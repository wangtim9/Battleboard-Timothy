Hunt, sink, and win with this brilliant Battleship game! Can you sink your opponents ships before all of yours go down? Command your battle and deploy your 5 ships(Carrier: 5 spaces, Battleship: 4 spaces, Destroyee: 3 spaces, Submarine: 3 spaces, and Patrol: 2 spaces) on the ocean grid. The vertical target grid keeps you from seeing each others deployment! Keep firing and record your strikes with the red pegs. Use the white pegs to keep track of your misses so you dont waste any shots. If you use logic and take some chances, youll sink your opponents battleship  but do it fast, because theyll be trying to do the same to you! Rule the oceans with your Battleship game!
